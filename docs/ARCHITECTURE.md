# AFK Raiders — Architecture

## Stack
| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite | Composition API suits a tick-driven UI |
| State | Pinia | Bridges engine ↔ UI cleanly; devtools support |
| Utilities | VueUse | `useIntervalFn` (tick loop), `useDocumentVisibility` (pause/catch-up), `useLocalStorage` |
| PWA | vite-plugin-pwa | Installable on web/iOS/Android from day one |
| Persistence | localStorage (MVP) | State is small; migrate to IndexedDB (localForage) when the log grows |
| Testing | Vitest | Deterministic engine → trivial to unit test |
| Later | Capacitor | Store distribution + native push, no rewrite |

## PWA Installation & Offline Support

The app is configured as a fully installable Progressive Web App targeting web, iOS, and Android:

- **Web installation:** Modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave) show a native install prompt after brief use. The [PWAInstallPrompt.vue](src/components/PWAInstallPrompt.vue) component surfaces the `beforeinstallprompt` event as a dismissible banner in the UI.
- **iOS installation:** Users install via "Share → Add to Home Screen" on Safari. Requires `apple-touch-icon` meta tag, `apple-mobile-web-app-capable`, and `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style` for status bar theming.
- **Android installation:** Native install prompt appears automatically after short engagement. Falls back to "Add to Home Screen" from the browser menu.

Configuration in [vite.config.ts](vite.config.ts):
- Manifest is auto-generated with app name, theme colors, icons (192×192 and 512×512 px in `any` and `maskable` variants), app shortcuts (e.g., "Ready Up" to deploy), and screenshot support for installation UI.
- Service worker auto-registers with `registerType: 'autoUpdate'` for transparent cache-first + network fallback (no user prompt).
- Scope and start_url ensure the app launches to `/` in standalone mode.

Meta tags in [index.html](index.html) enable iOS and desktop browser detection. Installation state is tracked in [useSettingsStore](src/stores/settingsStore.ts) via `beforeinstallprompt` and `appinstalled` events, plus `window.matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)')` for PWA mode detection.

## Golden rule: Engine ≠ UI
The simulation engine is **pure TypeScript with zero framework imports**. Vue renders state and dispatches the rare Handler action. The engine must run identically in Node (tests) and the browser.

## Design decisions

### 1. Seeded, deterministic ticks
- Save format: `{ state, seed, lastTickAt }` (JSON in localStorage).
- Tick cadence: one event every 30 seconds of real time.
- On load, `catchUp()` replays elapsed ticks — **capped at ~8 hours** — then shows a "While you were away…" summary (e.g., "your raider died twice and befriended a vending machine").
- Determinism makes catch-up cheap, bugs reproducible, and save-scumming pointless.
- All engine randomness flows through the seeded RNG. `Math.random()` is banned in `src/engine/`.

### 2. Content as weighted template tables
Events are picked by context (zone, greed level, mood, HP) and fill `{slot}` placeholders from content tables:
```json
{
  "id": "loot_mundane",
  "weight": 30,
  "requires": { "phase": "RAIDING" },
  "text": "Found {mundane_item}. {hoarder_justification}",
  "effects": { "backpackValue": "+1d6", "mood": "+1" }
}
```
Writing jokes never touches engine code — and this is the future community-content pipeline.

Events may also set `"effects": { "forcePhase": "..." }` to force a phase change. This powers `extraction_events.json`: during the EXTRACTING window (~90s extraction + a final tick to call the return shuttle, 4 ticks total) events can make extraction fail (`forcePhase: "RAIDING"` — backpack kept), succeed early (`forcePhase: "HUB"` — loot transferred to the home stash), or end in tragedy (`forcePhase: "DOWNED"` — bag lost).

Events may also gate themselves by `requires.dangerLevel` (`Low`, `Medium`, or `High`). The danger level is determined by a seeded combination of zone selection and zone condition selection (from `src/content/zones/zone_conditions.json`). The engine applies the matching danger-level profile in `src/engine/dangerLevelProfiles.ts`: Low has lower loot value and rarity bias, Medium raises loot upside and robot/extraction pressure, and High has the highest loot ceiling with the harshest robot and LZ risk. These profiles are the economy guardrail for risk/reward tuning.

Loot rarity selection also applies a small raider-mood bias in `eventResolver.ts`: positive mood nudges weights toward higher rarity and negative mood nudges toward lower rarity. The effect is intentionally mild and always secondary to danger-level profile tuning.

When an event awards backpack loot (`effects.backpackValue` producing a positive loot add), `processTick()` performs two additional independent consumable bonus rolls: one for a healing item and one for a shield recharger. This allows a single loot event to grant normal loot plus either or both consumable types.

When a shield mitigates damage, the comms feed should include a follow-up line that shows the split between shield charge lost and HP damage landed. That keeps the log readable while still reflecting the shield math.

### Home stash transfer
On every EXTRACTING → HUB transition (natural or event-forced), `processTick` merges the backpack into `state.homeStash` before the backpack resets. Duplicate item IDs stack quantities.

The stash has an enforced item cap (`HOME_STASH_ITEM_LIMIT`). Overflow items are auto-sold by lowest value first, and their value is converted to `state.coins` with a narrated `stash_overflow_sale` comms line. (Manual selling/trading is a future hub mechanic.)

`RaidState` also includes an optional manual `hiddenPocket` selection (the parody safe pocket). The UI (`BackpackPanel.vue`) explicitly sets/changes/clears this slot from current backpack items. On backpack-loss failures (DOWNED → HUB), the engine transfers exactly one unit of the selected pocket item into home stash before normal reset bookkeeping.

### Shield layer
`RaidState.shield` stores the current shield snapshot for the active raid. Shield damage rules live in `src/engine/shields.ts` so all incoming damage uses one deterministic calculation path. Negative HP event effects and failed robot encounters both route through the same helper.

Positive raider mood adds a small derived resilience bonus in `eventResolver.ts` for failed robot encounters only. It does not change robot raw damage; it slightly reduces the final HP loss after shield mitigation when mood is above zero.
The resulting shield-damage log line includes a short note when that bonus applies so the effect stays visible in the comms UI.

Shield rechargers are intentionally different from bandages:
- Bandages live in `RaidState.healingItems` and never extract.
- Shield rechargers live in `RaidState.backpack` with backpack-item metadata, are manual-use only, and extract if unused.
- HUB currently restores the equipped shield to full charge and 100% durability; loadout/store systems are the future hook for persisted shield state.
- `src/content/healing_items.json` and `src/content/shield_rechargers.json` are still required: they define weighted type selection for consumables awarded by both dedicated event effects and loot-bonus rolls.
- Damage events should remain source-first: the event text announces the encounter, then a shield summary line can explain how much shield charge was lost and how much HP damage landed.

### 3. Signal as the only real input
Signal regenerates (~1 per 10 min, capped at 5). Ready Up (2 Signal) starts DEPLOYING from HUB, Encourage/Scold (1 each) nudge hidden behavior weights, and Scold also reduces current greed before the next greed check; CALL EXTRACT (3 Signal) forces an extraction attempt. During RAIDING only one action may be queued at a time, so action buttons lock until the next tick applies the pending action.

### 4. Lifetime stat collection
`GameState.stats` tracks long-lived outcomes: extraction/death totals and context (zone + zone/time), robot defeats, and healing item usage.

Save migration in `gameStore.ts` backfills missing legacy stats from pre-existing `raider.extractCount` and `raider.deathCount` so historical totals remain consistent.

### 5. Phase timings and failure states
- Tick cadence remains 30 seconds.
- `HUB`: 20 ticks (10 minutes)
- `DEPLOYING`: 4 ticks (2 minutes)
- `RAIDING`: 60 ticks (30 minutes)
- `EXTRACTING`: 4 ticks (~2 minutes)
- `DOWNED`: 2 ticks

When RAIDING time expires without extraction, the next natural transition is DOWNED (zone nuke failure), not EXTRACTING.

### 6. State updates are immutable-style
`processTick(state, rng)` returns `{ state: GameState, events: LogEvent[] }` without mutating its input. This keeps Pinia reactivity simple, enables snapshot tests, and makes catch-up a pure fold over ticks.

### 7. Phase timings and timeout behavior
- Tick cadence remains 30 seconds.
- `HUB`: 20 ticks (10 minutes)
- `DEPLOYING`: 4 ticks (2 minutes)
- `RAIDING`: 60 ticks (30 minutes)
- `EXTRACTING`: 4 ticks (~2 minutes)
- `DOWNED`: 2 ticks

If RAIDING time expires without extracting, natural transition goes to DOWNED (zone nuke failure), not EXTRACTING.

## Testing strategy
- **Engine unit tests (Vitest):** given a fixed seed and starting state, assert the exact event sequence (snapshot tests).
- **Content validation tests:** every template's `{slots}` must resolve against content tables; weights must be positive; IDs unique.
- **Catch-up tests:** N elapsed hours → expected tick count, capped correctly.

## MVP boundaries (phase 1)
- Fully client-side; no network calls, no accounts, no telemetry.
- One raider, one zone pool, Ready Up/Encourage/Scold/CALL EXTRACT, offline catch-up, PWA installability.
- localStorage persistence with a schema `version` field for future migrations.
